# Week 4: Start Transcribing

## Preparation

- Look at the options for [transcription tools](https://github.com/andrewbenedictwallace/2018capstone/blob/master/software.md#image-tagging--transcription). Install Transkribus, download some annotated pages from Calisphere, and try it out. Spend some time on the existing Zoonverse project, look at the one on Shakespeare, and maybe see if anyone else is doing transcription there. Hopefully we can decide what to use next week at the latest – and maybe even offline this week – so we can start transcribing.

## In class

- Work with transcription tools.
- Organize transcription:
  - What tools will you use?
  - What data will you be transcribing? How will you divide it up?
  - How will you format your transcriptions?
