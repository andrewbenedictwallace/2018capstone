# Week 4: Neural Nets / Start Transcribing

## Preparation

- Look at the options for [transcription tools](https://github.com/andrewbenedictwallace/2018capstone/blob/master/software.md#image-tagging--transcription). Install Transkribus, download some annotated pages from Calisphere, and try it out. Spend some time on the existing Zoonverse project, look at the one on Shakespeare, and maybe see if anyone else is doing transcription there. Hopefully we can decide what to use next week at the latest – and maybe even offline this week – so we can start transcribing.

- Chapter on neural networks. (Check back soon, I just need to dig it up).

## In class

- Discuss reading, neural networks.
- Distribute some image files.
- Make transcribing plans.
