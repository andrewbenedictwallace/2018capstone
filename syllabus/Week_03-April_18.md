# April 18: Early Modern Books

## Before Class

 - GitHub
   - Look around GitHub, the site I'm using for this syllabus. It's built around git, a version control system that we'll learn about later on. Make notes of whatever's most confusing.
   - For now, just make sure you can find your way around. Find the list of files. One file is a list of software we'll be using, another has some links to material about early modern books. Take a look at both. 
   - **Not required:** if  you're okay giving your info to another corporation, sign up for a GitHub account and:
     - Set your name and avatar. (I'm bad at learning these, so it'll help me!)
     - Click the "Watch" and "Star" buttons to get email notifications about the class site.
     - Click the "Issues" tab at the top of this page. "Issues" are designed for reporting bugs, but they're good for all kinds of communication about a project. The only catch is that only paid accounts can be made private. I don't have a paid account, so anything you post on GitHub will be visible to anyone. (Stick to email for private communication!)
     - If you're okay using GitHub Issues for class communication, click the "New Issue" button, and use an issue to let me know! If you're not, write an email to let me know.
     - Be aware that GitHub is something employers look at to get a sense of your technical skills. If this makes you panic, don't use it. But if you can use it and stay sane, it's a good way to establish some credentials. Don't worry about looking ignorant at first though â€“ everyone is! You'll look like smart people learning new things!
  
- Reading

  Explore the links about early modern books. Spend as much time as you can getting a feel for the material we'll be working with and thinking about questions we might address. Visit the zooniverse site and spend 30 min or more labelling annotations. Keep an eye out for interesting things we're not labelling.
  
- Software
  - Finish installing Anaconda, if you have space.
  - Pick a text editor and install it. (I have a list on the software page.)
