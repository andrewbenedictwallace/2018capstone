# Resources for studying early modern books:

(Cut and pasted from a message from Dawn Childress!)

- Here is sort of a standard intro to book history: https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3403038/darnton_historybooks.pdf?sequence=2
- also, “The book as an expressive form” (McKenzie) in his book “Bibliography and the Sociology of Texts” - starts on page 7: http://socrates.acadiau.ca/courses/engl/rcunningham/fall2008/4313-5013/pdf/mckenzie.pdf
- British Library machine-learning experiment: http://blogs.bl.uk/digital-scholarship/2015/04/the-british-library-machine-learning-experiment.html (generates tags from page images)
- and this has some interesting stuff in it re: studying annotation in printed books (it’s the Annotated Books Online people):  https://github.com/andrewbenedictwallace/2018capstone/blob/master/Building%20a%20digital%20bookwheel%20together%20Bibliothecae_1_14_II%2Bbozze.63-80.pdf
