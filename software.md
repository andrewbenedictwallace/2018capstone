# Useful Software

## Python

We'll be using Python 3. Python 2 and 3 are [not compatible](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-2-or-3/), and a lot of older code uses Python 2 (for example, MacOS doesn't even come with 3).

Anacadonda Python is a huge download, but it comes with lots of stuff pre-installed: [https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html)

# Text Editors

You *could* edit Python in TextEdit or Notepad, but text editors that are made specifically for writing code are a lot more useful.

 - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). MacOS, Windows, & Linux - Open Source. From Microsoft, but cross-platform and free. It seems to be bundled with Anaconda. I haven't used it, but it's supposed to be good.
 - [Atom](https://atom.io/). MacOS, Windows, & Linux - Open Source. I mostly use Atom.
 - [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) MacOS, Windows, & Linux - $80 Better Python support than Atom. Costs money, but you can try free for as long as you can tolerate being nagged to buy.
 - XCode. MacOS only. Big and confusing, not all that useful. But better than TextEdit.

### [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)

An alternative to using a text editor. Write little blocks of code, then execute and see the results in your browser. It's a web app, but people often run it on their own computer (it comes with Anaconda).

## Git

Version control - it keeps track of different versions of your files.

# Image tagging / transcription

## [Transcribus](https://transkribus.eu/Transkribus/)

Specifically for transcribing historical documents. Part of the EU-funded [READ Project](https://read.transkribus.eu/), the only people I know doing text recognition of complicated handwritten documents. Their code is available [on GitHub]()

## [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/)

What we've [been using](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/kirschbombe/book-annotation-classification/) I'll talk to Dawn about how to set up a project.

Also just noticed [this project](https://www.shakespearesworld.org) transcribing Shakespeare's manuscripts. Since it isn't our project we don't get access to the data, but it's probably be worth looking at to see how they do things.
